                        Share knowledge, share experience and help the community. During my study many times we were curious what would be the questions at a job interview for a .Net developer position just to mention were on the .net study path.
                        Some companies focus on more core concept questions, but others prefer to ask trendy questions about cutting age technologies.
                        How the complexity of the questions progress for junior, regular or senior developers and generally how much do I know.
                        Many developers have doubts if they should apply for a job position or not. If they are ready to jump up from seniority level to another higher. There are many articles like: "Most asked .net questions" which are quite helpful, but in real life sometimes the interviewers come up with really unexpected questions.
                        You can be prepared for many of these questions by sharing your .Net interview.
                        The key concept, here are the questions and the technical part of the interview, but not the company itself. The idea is not learning by rote a company specific questions, but to generally understand what expertise and skill set you have and what you may be missing.

                        Shared .Net interview platform targets interview questions regarding .Net technology stack. Some questions can be very general and not only applying to .Net.
                        Developers from around the world can share their experience. They can check if the tech level requirements vary regarding different regions around the globe.
                        By sharing your interview you also give a tip about the company, its nationality, size and job base location, but not specific company name as this is not the point.
                        You also can describe yourself, well it is up to you. Uploading file to a specific question is also possible as you might be given a particular problem to solve.
                        The platform will add more features soon, but let's begin with a simple way of sharing an interview with the .Net community.
                        In the beginning there will be no many questions and it may look a little boring
                        but it depends on us to make it glow with plenty of question and interesting discussions on different interviews.
                        I will personally share real interviews starting from junior developer and advancing to regular.
                        Please take a part, help improve.
