                        Share knowledge share experience and help comunity. When studing many times the question among students was what woud they ask me at .net job interview?
                        Are the questions different for junior, reqular or senior developer? May be there ara some trendy questions as latest version of C# is out...
                        'm I ready for a job interview or should I apply for this cool senior dev. posotion with so many benefits hmm...
                        You can answer many of this question by sharing your .net interview. The key here are the questionsnot not the company you are applaing for.
                        The idea is not learn by rote a company specific questions but to generally understand what expertise and skill set you have and what you may be missing.
